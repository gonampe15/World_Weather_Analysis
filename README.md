# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis looks at different weather data around the world and offers insight to users which can be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.

## Travel Destinations Maps

After the beta testers are prompted to input minimum and maximum temperature preferences, the data frame was cleaned for null hotel entries and empty rows. Markers and pins were created for the remainder of the hotels.
